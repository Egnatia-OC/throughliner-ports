# QUEUE.md migration checklist — old format → two-section

No new skill and no hook change: this is a guided manual pass, working item by
item, drafting the converted queue and **getting the user's approval before
writing, because a project being migrated may have been adopted moments ago and
may not be a committed git repo — so there may be nothing to recover.**

**When this applies.** A project's `QUEUE.md` format is the one project doc that
reliably falls behind as the method evolves. LOG is already per-entry + index,
CLAUDE.md is topped up by session_start, and SPEC is format-agnostic — so they need
little or nothing.

```
recorded epoch below FORMAT_EPOCH  ->  convert with this checklist, running
                                       every epoch section from the recorded
                                       number upward
```

The oldest shape this reaches is the multi-section queue —
`## Red flags · ## Batches · ### Parked · ## Deferred tests · ## Captures` — but
which conversions run is decided by the recorded epoch, not by what the file
looks like.

**Plain-language guard.** A consumer reads whatever you say while migrating. Say
"your queue" not "QUEUE.md's parse structure"; "the ready-to-build line" not "the
cleared-to-run marker". **The structural terms below are for you to read, not to
narrate.**

## How to run it

**Run every epoch section from the project's recorded epoch up to the current
`FORMAT_EPOCH`, in order.** /setup reads the recorded number from
`.throughliner-format-epoch` and enters here; a project with no marker predates
it and starts at the beginning. Each section says which epoch it brings the
project to, so a project already past one skips it.

```
1. read the existing QUEUE.md; identify each old section and item
2. convert each item per the rules of each epoch section you are running
3. DRAFT the whole converted queue and show it for approval before writing
   # not a contradiction of write-first: see "Why this shows before it writes"
4. after writing, the post_tool_use lint confirms the new queue is well-formed
5. /setup writes the new epoch marker LAST, once the conversions have landed
```

## Epochs 1–3 — the two-section queue

Everything from here to "Preserve everything real" brings a project up to
**epoch 3**. Run it where the recorded epoch is below 3; a project already at 3
or above has a two-section queue and starts at Epoch 4 below.

### The target shape

The old sections all collapse into **two**: `## Processed` and `## Unprocessed`.

```
each work item becomes:
    a #### heading                 its one-line description
    a [slug] at the END of it      kebab-case, for LOG traceability
    rationale prose beneath
    an optional user-credit        "captured by you" — ONLY when the user
                                   personally raised it. Otherwise unmarked:
                                   AI is the default author, no AI label written.
    a red-flag marker              only if it carries a security/privacy risk:
                                   Red flag · State: cleared | uncleared
```

```
which section:
    Processed    vetted, agreed and ready (or designed and buildable).
                 Within it, --- Cleared to run above this line --- separates
                 greenlit-to-build (above) from not-yet-cleared (below).
    Unprocessed  captured but not yet fully processed (still needs thought).
```

The current header prose for each section is shipped in setup.md's scaffold —
**re-copy it rather than writing your own** (rule 3).

### The judgment rules a find-and-replace can't make

**1. Old red flags.**

```
work remains   ->  a work item carrying the Red flag · State: marker
it's done      ->  moves to LOG history
never          ->  left as a bare markerless line
```

**2. Old batch / parked / deferred-test items** → work items with a slug (and a
`captured by you` credit only where the user clearly raised it), placed **by
judgment**:

```
vetted and ready                      ->  Processed
still needs thought                   ->  Unprocessed
a deferred test ONLY THE USER can run ->  a [user] item with a described
                                          walkthrough
```

**3. Method-shipped boilerplate is refreshed by re-copy, never regenerated from
guesses.** FAQ files, the QUEUE.md header prose, CLAUDE-TEMPLATE scaffolding — copy
the *current shipped template* over the stale file rather than rewriting it from
the method docs.

```
per-file discriminator:
    the user's own work   ->  migrate by judgment
    method boilerplate    ->  re-copy the template
```

(Observed: a session nearly rewrote a project's FAQ from the method docs when a
verbatim re-copy was correct.)

**4. Approval before write.** Draft, show, get the okay, then write.

**5. Drop empty section placeholders.** An empty old Red-flags / Deferred-tests /
Parked block just disappears — nothing carries over.

## Epoch 4 — build blocks on cleared work

**Every item cleared to run needs a build block before a run can build it.** A
run reads a generated view assembled from those blocks and never reads QUEUE.md,
so a cleared item without one reaches the run with no instructions and halts it
as underspecified.

````
--- Build block ---
Changes: <what changes, in which files>
Acceptance: <how to tell it worked>
Red flag: <cleared | uncleared>          # only where the item carries one
Refused: <the option, and why it lost>   # one line per refusal, or omit
--- End build block ---
````

```
a cleared item's own prose already    ->  lift those sentences into the block.
  says what changes and where             The prose stays where it is; the
                                          block is a projection of it, never
                                          a move.
a cleared item that does NOT say      ->  it never passed the keep check. Move
  what changes inside its files           it below the readiness line and
                                          process it at the next /plan, rather
                                          than inventing instructions for it.
a held item, or a capture             ->  nothing. Neither is built until it is
                                          cleared, and the lint asks nothing of
                                          them.
a `[user]` or `[freeform]` item       ->  nothing. Neither is built from a block.
```

**Write the blocks with the user, not for them.** Telling instruction from
decision history is a judgment, which is the whole reason the split is authored
at the keep-step rather than computed by a script. A migration doing it silently
would make exactly the call the design reserves for a moment the user is present.

**Only refusals travel out of the history.** A recorded "X was rejected because
Y" goes into the block; everything else stays in the item. A build that cannot
see why an option was rejected proposes it again and stops to ask.

**Nothing is deleted.** The block sits beneath the item's rationale, which stays
inline and whole — that is what the throughline requires, and the generated view
is regenerated rather than merged, so nothing is ever reconciled back.

**Check it landed:** run the generator and read its summary line — it prints how
many cleared items it found and how many carried a block. Equal numbers mean the
migration is complete.

## Preserve everything real

**Migration must lose no content the user wants kept.**

```
each item's full rationale prose  ->  carried across verbatim (re-authored only
                                      to fit the new shape, NEVER truncated)
an old "captured by you" signal   ->  kept
an old "by Claude" label          ->  just drops (AI is the default now)
any red-flag risk                 ->  kept as a marked work item
```

**When unsure whether something is the user's own work or method boilerplate,
ask** — don't guess and overwrite.

## Validated live (Hexboard, 2026-07-29)

The ad-hoc form of this checklist passed cleanly in a consumer project (host
1.15.0-test6): the QUEUE header prose was re-copied from setup.md rather than
regenerated (rule 3 fired unprompted); empty Red-flags / Deferred-tests / Parked
placeholders were dropped; a Batches › Build item became a `[user]` line; four
Captures became `#### ` work items with slug + provenance, full rationale
preserved; approval-before-write was honoured; the lint ran clean; no content was
lost.
