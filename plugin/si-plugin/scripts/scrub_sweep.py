"""On-demand sweep for other people's private information in project docs.

Why this exists: a project's docs get committed, and a commit is permanent even
if the text is deleted later. The rule that actually protects people is not
writing their details down in the first place — but a rule only protects what
comes after it. This finds what is already there.

It found a real one: a third party named in committed log entries of a public
repository, readable by anyone for about six weeks. Nobody had scrubbed badly —
the text read as unremarkable when it was written, because at the time neither
person was thinking about a third party at all. A grep found every instance in
seconds. That is the trade this script makes: mechanical search is exhaustive in
a way a judgment pass can't match, so use it for coverage and use the write-time
rule for prevention.

Usage:
    python scrub_sweep.py [--name "A Name"] [--name "Another"] [path]

    --name   a name (or any string) you already know to look for. Repeatable.
             Every occurrence is reported — this is the exhaustive half.
    path     the project root to sweep. Defaults to the current directory.

With no --name, the script runs only the proper-noun pass.

Two passes, and they answer different questions:

  1. KNOWN STRINGS — every occurrence of each --name, with file and line.
     Complete by construction. If you know the name, this finds all of it.
  2. UNEXPLAINED PROPER NOUNS — capitalised words in the project's own docs
     that look like personal names and aren't part of the project's own
     vocabulary. This pass CANNOT be complete and does not try to be: it
     surfaces candidates for a human to look at. Expect false positives; that
     is the correct bias for a privacy check.

The script only reads. It never edits, and it never decides what is sensitive.
And note plainly, wherever the result is reported: **removing text from a file
does not remove it from git history.** If something has already been committed,
that's a separate decision for the user — rewrite history, scrub forward only,
or make the repository private.
