# LOG

Full session entries, newest first. Each entry is written by /done. This file covers the current release — older entries are in per-release log files (LOG/log-v*.md).

## [HASH] — /next batch presentation slimmed to title + gist + entry counts

Step 1.5 of next.md was dumping the full batch text — title plus every entry — at the moment the user was about to confirm a build. The user had just written that text in QUEUE.md and could open it anytime, so the re-render was noise without information. The new shape gives them what they actually need at that moment: which batch (title), what it's about (one-line gist drawn from the rationale), and how big (entry counts split build / test). The full text isn't lost — it moves into _build.md the moment they confirm, which is where it's actually referenced during execution. Two captures came out of the build: a faster LOG-hash-backfill design (single `git log -n 1` for the common case, `git grep -l` to short-circuit when clean, scope restricted to LOG/log.md and LOG/index.md so archived files containing the literal string `[HASH]` in prose don't false-positive) to fold into the already-queued backfill batch; and a /next scope-discipline rule — drop the "Adding to scope instead" sub-section that lets out-of-scope ideas leak into the active build's commit and log entry, replace with a narrower exception keyed to why-pipeline coherence.

**Files touched:**
- plugin/si-plugin/docs/next.md: Step 1.5 presentation bullet rewritten

**Routed to Captures:** faster LOG hash backfill (fold-in note for existing batch); /next no-fold-into-scope rule

## 1a74685 — /plan: parked 2 stuck audit captures under new /audit skill dependency; 6 new captures from session

The trickle-up audit and output-tag overhaul audit have been stuck in Captures across 6-7 /plan rounds — each session, new captures crowded them out, and /plan's dialogic capture-by-capture flow doesn't fit the read-many-propose-many shape audit work actually has. This session parked both pending a new /audit-skill capture that proposes a dedicated procedure for audit work (target on invocation, systematic read, propose moves, output to captures or batches). Five other captures came out of side-discussions: an affirmative-batch-definition fix (plan.md Ground rules has the negative form but no positive statement that batches are build-or-test only); a /next routing rule for mid-build discoveries of user-runnable testing; a /plan instruction to think about testing when authoring a batch; an append-vs-ordering rule tension between plugin-behaviour.md's two existing statements (captures append to bottom vs Claude owns sequencing) with a reconciliation of Claude-directed-where-applicable, oldest-first as default; and a between-captures checkpoint for /plan Step 2 so the user isn't forced to interrupt to /done. Alex also edited the QUEUE.md preamble inline to correct an inaccurate "builds first, then tests" framing — some batches have no build section. Item 3 (repo installation guide) opened mid-interview and remained in active Captures for next session.

**Queue changes:**
- 2 captures moved to Parked (trickle-up audit, output-tag overhaul audit) with dependency note on /audit skill
- 6 captures added (affirmative batch definition; /next user-testing routing; /plan testing during batch authoring; /audit skill design; append-vs-ordering rule reconciliation; between-captures checkpoint)
- QUEUE.md preamble inline-edited by user replacing "builds first, then tests" with build-session / test-session description
- LOG/index.md and LOG/log-v1.7.0.md: [HASH] placeholder for v1.7.0 entry backfilled to e5d3ca4

**Captures routed:** 2 parked
